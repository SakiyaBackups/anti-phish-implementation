# Anti-Phish Implementation

This library is an anti-phising implementation that is easy to implement in your bot. This library was made to flatten the curve on the growing rate of phising attempts on discord.

```
    npm i anti-phish-implementation
```

## Usage


### Default

```js
    const { Fish } = require("anti-phish-implementation"); //import fish client
    const { Client } = require("discord.js"); //import disc client

    const bot = new Client({ intents: ["GUILD_MESSAGES", "GUILDS"] }); //create disc client
    const fish = new Fish(bot, { enabled: true }); //create fish client

    fish.init(); //initialize the anti-phising feature
```

### Kick / Ban

```js
    const { Fish } = require("anti-phish-implementation"); //import fish client
    const { Client } = require("discord.js"); //import disc client

    const bot = new Client({ intents: ["GUILD_MESSAGES", "GUILDS"] }); //create disc client
    const fish = new Fish(bot, { enabled: true, kick: false, ban: false }); //create fish client

    fish.init(); //initialize the anti-phising feature
```

### Custom Embed / Ban & Kick Reason

    const { Client, MessageEmbed } = require("discord.js"); //import disc client

    const tstEm = new MessageEmbed().setColor("RED").setTitle("Test Embed").setDescription("{member} hey");
    const fish = new Fish(bot, { enabled: true, kick: false, ban: false, reason: "Test Reason", embed: tstEm }); //create fish client
